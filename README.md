# Project Overview: Backorder Prediction
### Problem Statement
Backorders occur when demand exceeds available inventory, disrupting production, logistics, and transportation. Proactive backorder prediction allows organizations to streamline their planning, reduce unexpected operational strain, and maintain customer satisfaction.

Using structured and historical data from ERP systems (including inventories, supply chains, and sales), this project aims to classify products as likely to go on backorder ("Yes") or not ("No"). The goal is to develop a predictive model to forecast backorders and enable informed decision-making.

### Approach
To solve the problem, the following classical machine learning workflow is implemented:

### Data Exploration:

Understand dataset characteristics, distributions, and potential anomalies.
Identify missing values and outliers.
Data Cleaning:

Handle missing or invalid entries.
Normalize and encode categorical variables.
Feature Engineering:

Select meaningful features that contribute to backorder prediction.
Create new derived features (if applicable) to enhance model performance.
Model Building:

Train and tune machine learning models using algorithms such as HistGradientBoostingClassifier and others for comparison.
Perform hyperparameter optimization to enhance performance.
Model Testing and Evaluation:

Use metrics like ROC-AUC, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score to evaluate model performance.
Analyze the confusion matrix for insights into false positives and false negatives.

# Project Implementation
### Code Structure
Modular Design:The code is organized into separate functions for data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
Compliance:Followed PEP-8 coding standards for readability and maintainability.
Portability:Tested on various operating systems to ensure consistent behavior.
Testable:Each function and component is written to allow unit testing.

### Evaluation Metrics

The project uses the following metrics for evaluation:

ROC-AUC: Measures the model's ability to distinguish between classes.
Precision: Measures the accuracy of positive predictions.
Recall: Measures the proportion of actual positives correctly identified.
F1-Score: Provides a balance between precision and recall.
Confusion Matrix: Provides a detailed breakdown of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
